# SOV
SOV is the first self-deflationary token on EOS and the world's first variable-rate self-deflationary cryptoccurency.  

SOV has a starting supply of 1 Billion and an ending supply of 21 million.  

Deflation occurs via a burn % of every transfer that adjusts according to supply over 3 phases.  Each phase is set up to incetivize a different type of activity (accumulation, saving, usage).  

Phase 1 accumulation: 0.05% - 0.35% / 1 billion - 930 Million
Phase 2 saving: 0.50% - 1.25%  / 930 million - 195 million
Phase 3 usage: 195 million - 21 million / 1.0.% - 0.00%

Each phase is also further broke into 7 stages each, for a total of 21 stages. 

Deflation also occurs via the Airburn (7.5 million unclaimed tokens that were allocated for Genesis accounts can be destroyed once a week by anyone with an EOS account).  

SOV has no ICO, No Pre-sale, investors, or financial backers of any kind. 
SOV is a completely decentralized project open to all who wish to contribute.
